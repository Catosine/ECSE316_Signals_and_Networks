## Assignments  
> [Assignment1: Network Programming and DNS](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE316_Signals_and_Networks/tree/master/assignment1)  
> In this assignment, we implemented a _domain name system_ (DNS) client using sockets in Python.    

> [Assignment2: Fast Fourier Transformation and Applications](https://github.com/Catosine/ECSE316_Signals_and_Networks/tree/master/assignment2)  
> In this assignment, we implemented two versions of the Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). 
> One of them will be a brute force approach that follows directly from the formula. The second one 
> will be an implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which follows a divide-and-conquer
> approach to algorithm design. In particular, the FFT we will focus on is the Cooley-Tukey FFT.
